// For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table WHERE their age is over 50

// people table schema
// id
// name
// age
// You should return all people fields where their age is over 50 and order by the age descending

// NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

-- Create your SELECT statement here
SELECT * from people WHERE age > 50
ORDER BY age DESC
