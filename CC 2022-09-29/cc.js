// Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

// Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)

// "4",  "5" --> "9"
// "34", "5" --> "39"
// "", "" --> "0"
// "2", "" --> "2"
// "-5", "3" --> "-2"
// Notes:

// If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

// Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)

function oddOrEven(array) { 
    if (array.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0) % 2 === 0){

//   Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

// Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

// Example:

// Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
// Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
    let myArr = this.split(" ")
    let newArr = myArr.map(item => item.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + item.slice(1))
